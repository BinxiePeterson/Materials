# Kigali Foundational School in Research Data Science 
22 October â€“ 2 November, 2018
University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda

## Background and purpose 
The goal of this workshop is to train researchers in Research Data Science (RDS). RDS refers to the principles and practice of Open Science and research data management and curation, the use of a range of data platforms and infrastructures, large scale analysis, statistics, visualization and modelling techniques, software development and data annotation. These are important tools for extracting useful information from data and these tools are useful in every research area. 

A 10-day workshop, organized by CODATA, ICTP and EAIFR, will be conducted at the University of Rwanda, Kigali to introduce participants to the skills of RDS.
