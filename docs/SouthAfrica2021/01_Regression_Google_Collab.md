# Apache Spark on Google Colab

Google Collaboratory (Colab) allows notebooks execute code on Google's cloud servers, meaning you can leverage the power of Google hardware, including GPUs and TPUs, regardless of the power of your machine. 

We are going to use this free cloud resource to run a regression analysis on a common open data set that describes housing data in the Boston, US area.
