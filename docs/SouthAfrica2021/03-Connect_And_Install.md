# Connect to Your OpenStack VM and Install Python and/or R and Jupyter Notebook

Prerequsites: 
   * The software that will allow you to connect to your VM. This is called _Terminal_ and installed by default on a Mac. If you are on a Windows based machine you should use an appropriate terminal software. I suggest PuTTY for new users. 
   * Your OpenStack SSH Key created in lesson 2. The IP Address of your VM from lesson 2. 

**Notes on syntax:**
   * If you see ```text like this``` it is a command to enter directly into your terminal (it can be cut and pasted).
   * If you see a ```%``` or ```$``` character before ```text like this``` it represents the prompt and should not be part of your text.
   * If something is in brackets like ```<This_Text>``` it needs your unique text and should be replaced with the appropriate value.
