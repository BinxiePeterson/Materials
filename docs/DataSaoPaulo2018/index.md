# Sao Paulo School of Research Data Science 
December 3 â€“ 14, 2018
ICTP-SAIFR, Sao Paulo, Brazil

## Background and purpose 
The goal of this workshop is to train researchers in Research Data Science (RDS). RDS refers to the principles and practice of Open Science and research data management and curation, the use of a range of data platforms and infrastructures, large scale analysis, statistics, visualization and modelling techniques, software development and data annotation. These are important tools for extracting useful information from data and these tools are useful in every research area. 

A 10-day workshop, organized by CODATA, RDA, ICTP and SAIFR, was conducted at the ICTP-SAIFR, Sao Paulo to introduce participants to the skills of RDS.
